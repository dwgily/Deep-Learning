# Pothole Detection System

The **Pothole Detection System** is a deep learning-based project designed to detect potholes in real-time using the Single Shot Detection (SSD) algorithm. The system analyzes images captured by a camera mounted on vehicles, accurately identifying potholes under varying conditions, and plays a crucial role in improving road safety and maintenance.

## Overview

Potholes are a significant cause of accidents, transportation delays, and economic losses. This system aims to mitigate these issues by leveraging cutting-edge deep learning techniques to detect potholes in real-time. By using SSD, the model can classify and localize potholes in images, making it ideal for real-world applications.

## Features
